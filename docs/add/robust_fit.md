**RobustFit ( Ordinary Least Squares - OLS) **
This is a standard python module.
( Robust Linear Models may be investigated )

Inputs: dates, dependent values

Num years = ceiling ( ( beginning date â€“ end date ) / 365.25 )

W1 = 2 * pi / 365.25
W2 = W1 / num years

Independent_arr [ column1 ] = 1â€™s
Independent_arr [ column2 ] = [ cos ( W1 * d ) for d in dates ]
Independent_arr [ column3 ] = [ sin ( W1 * d ) for d in dates ]
Independent_arr [ column4 ] = [ cos ( W2 * d ) for d in dates ]
Independent_arr [ column5 ] = [ sin ( W2 * d ) for d in dates ]
