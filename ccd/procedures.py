"""Functions for producing change model parameters.

The change module provides a 'detect' function used to produce change model
parameters for multi-spectra time-series data. It is implemented in a manner
independent of data sources, input formats, pre-processing routines, and
output formats.

In general, change detection is an iterative, two-step process: an initial
stable period of time is found for a time-series of data and then the same
window is extended until a change is detected. These steps repeat until all
available observations are considered.

The result of this process is a list-of-lists of change models that correspond
to observation spectra.

Preprocessing routines are essential to, but distinct from, the core change
detection algorithm. See the `ccd.filter` for more details related to this
step.

For more information please refer to the `CCDC Algorithm Description Document`.
